h1. Chatter

A real-time chat app using WebSockets on Rails, Client-side Coffee-Script, JQuery, HTML5.

h2. Diagnostics

Opens a WebSocket to the backend. Any time a chat message is sent from the browser, it’s sent to the server and then broadcasted to each connecting client and displayed on the page.

There are a few key pieces to this implementation. I use Faye’s WebSockets implementation that provides the standard WebSockets API. This allows me to build a Rack middleware that responds to WebSockets.

JavaScript on the browser opens a WebSocket connection to the server and responds to a WebSocket message being received from the server to display the chat message.
